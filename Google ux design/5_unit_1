### Color in UX design  

Colors can convey emotions, signal actions, and add variety.   

Red, attracts a lot of attention. That's why things like exit signs, emergency buttons, and stop signs are red.   
Blue, communicate serenity and feelings of calmness or peace. That's one reason why blue is considered widely appealing.

### Add images to your mockups  

communicate a message without using words, important for decision    
scanning, scrolling 交互，使用真实图片 mockup  

Images also create an emotional response from users.

### layouts  
ways to arrange elements on a page.   
Layouts usually refer to the specific placement of text, style, icons, and images.   

The goal of layouts is to present information in a logical way, making the important elements stand out.   

模板化程度比较高的页面类型 home screens, login screens, and even checkout screens  


### Use grids to guide layouts  
the correct placement of elements on your page can improve user flow and make it easier to navigate.   

basic grids. These intersecting lines divide pages into small squares that allow you to easily layout elements in a design.   
basic grids are useful to help you design consistently  

A layout grid is a series of columns and alleys that allow you to organize elements in a design.   
Columns are the colored blocks, and alleys are the spaces between the columns.   

website on a laptop or desktop computer, the layout grid might have 12 columns.   
tablet or app includes four to eight columns  
a smartwatch has only one column.   

grids create clarity and consistency. An effective grid guides the eye, making it easier and more pleasant to scan elements on the screen.   
grids quicken the design process, making it faster to place elements on the screen.    
grids make it easier to collaborate on designs.

### Use containment in layouts  

Containment uses visual barriers to keep designs neat and organized.   
Barriers like lines or colors help limit content to a specific section of a design.   

There are four methods of containment: dividers, borders, fill, and shadow.   
dividers, lines that separate sections. They can be simple yet effective tools for quickly breaking up content that doesn't belong together.   
borders, use lines to break up sections of a page. Borders are continuous lines that often form shapes like squares or rectangles.   
fill, assigns colors to borders and shapes, just as you might think the color fills in the object. This makes content stand out, which creates a new focal point within the mockup.   
shadows, create dimension. Often, designers use shadows in combination with borders or fill. Shadows help break up elements even further. You feel like it's coming off the page.

### Use negative (white) space in layouts  

White space is the gaps between elements in a design. often referred to as negative space.   

the use of white space can provide emphasis on a focal point within the design. help focus the user on an action they need to take.   
For example, think about the Google Search homepage; the search bar and Google logo are surrounded by white space. The use of white space clearly communicates the action users should take: search.   

the use of white space can help group items together, which is also known as proximity.   
When elements like buttons or text are placed close to each other on a page, users naturally group these elements together and expect them to be related.   

white space helps with readability. Leaving more white space between elements makes it easier to focus on each element.   

Having too little white space increases the chance of error.
