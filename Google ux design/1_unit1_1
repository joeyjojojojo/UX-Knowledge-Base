### The basics of user experience design  

user experience is how a person, the user, feels about interacting with or experiencing a product.   
A product is a good, service, or feature. 商品、服务、功能   

for a user to have a good experience, the product needs to be usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. 可用性、公平性、愉悦性、实用性    
usable - the design, structure, and purpose of the product are clear to everyone.   
  ketchup bottle - glass >> plastic squeezable = easier to use & control 挤出来的量  

equitable - your designs are useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds  
  for people with very different life experiences from your own  

enjoyable - creates a positive connection between the user and the product  
  ordering takeout food online - see photos of dishes and read reviews from other people who have eaten there，>> make a more informed choice about what to order， you feeling happier about the product  
  ** how do we figure out what makes a user happy with the product? research 

useful - solve our problem   
  map app - if you're lost, a map app telling you how to get home is useful. But if the app can't find your current location, it's not so useful anymore. 


WHY ?  
When people like a product  >>  they use that product a lot  +  and they recommended it to their friends.

### Design for good user experience  
Predicting user roadblocks and potential design mishaps is what good UX design is all about.  
  Norman doors - poor user experience 

case1：icon - save space on the screen, pleasing to look at, easy to understand, no matter the user's native language.   
       ** But sometimes the meaning of an icon is impossible to figure out  >>  icon + text  

case2：shopping app - add to shopping cart, then show out of stock 缺货

### The product development lifecycle   
  Brainstorm - discovery：needs or challenges the user might have.  ** research 
  Define - is all about using the insights from the brainstorm stage and starting to narrow the focus. the team determines concrete ways that the product being developed will impact the user   
    storyboards - sketches that help explore the user's experience  
    wireframes - provide outlines of the content layout.  
    prototypes - models that allow UX designers to test the functionality of a design. 
  Design - actively develop ideas, and they also check that all specifications from the define stage are realistic.   是否现实 ？    
  
  Test - the team evaluates the product design based on feedback from potential users.   
         ** helps the team focus on the user first and foremost and the designs second.  
         ** interactivity of the design：UX designers and front-end engineers
